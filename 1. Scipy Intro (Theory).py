# # Scipy Intro
# 

# 1. Scipy is a  scientific computation library that uses numpy underneath
# 2. SciPy stands for Scientific Python.

# # Advantages of scipy

# 1. It is perfect for image manipulation.
# 2. It offers basic processing features for mathematical operations.
# 3. It provides effective integration for numerics and their optimizations.
# 4. It also facilitates the processing of signals.

# # What is Scipy

# 1. SciPy is a scientific computation library that uses NumPy underneath.
# 
# 2. SciPy stands for Scientific Python.
# 
# 3. It provides more utility functions for optimization, stats and signal processing.
# 
# 4. Like NumPy, SciPy is open source so we can use it freely.
# 
# 5. SciPy was created by NumPy's creator Travis Olliphant.

# # Why use Scipy?

# If SciPy uses NumPy underneath, why can we not just use NumPy?
# 
# SciPy has optimized and added functions that are frequently used in NumPy and Data Science.

# # Which language scipy is written?

# SciPy is predominantly written in Python, but a few segments are written in C.

# # Where is the SciPy Codebase?

# The source code for SciPy is located at this github repository https://github.com/scipy/scipy
